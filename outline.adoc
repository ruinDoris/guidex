Julien Ponge <julien.ponge@insa-lyon.fr>; Thomas Segismont <tsegismont@gmail.com>

== Step 1

Starter implementation with Vert.x web, Freemarker templates and Vert.x JDBC, 1 verticle, simple code.

== Step 2

Evolve into 2 verticles, pass them configuration data (port, jdbc settings, sql queries, etc), and deploy from a main verticle.
Communication through the event bus.

Deploy 2 HTTP verticles.

== Step 3

Introduce io.vertx:vertx-service-proxy (+vertx-codegen and pom config) to refactor the event bus code into services.

== Step 4

Testing

== Step 5

HttpClient / integrate with a 3rd-party service.

== Step 6

REST API

== Step 7

Access control and security

* server-side pages using Shiro auth
// (put warnings on not abusing internal APIs to put state / threadlocal issues + some parts are blocking so can be a perf problem)
* API using JWT tokens
* HTTPS all the things

== Step 8

Refactor to RxJava.
