= Client-side web application using AngularJS 

TIP: The corresponding source code is in the `step-9` folder of the guide repository.

So far our web interface was using traditional server-side rendering of HTML content.
Some types of applications can take advantage of client-side rendering to improve user experience by avoiding full page reloads, and approaching the experience of native applications.

Many popular frameworks exist for that purpose.
We chose the popular http://angularjs.org/[AngularJS framework] for this guide, but one could equally choose https://facebook.github.io/react/[React], https://vuejs.org/[Vue.js], http://riotjs.com/[Riot] or another framework/library without any loss of generality.

== Simplifying the HTTP verticle

A client-side application needs a backend that exposes:

1. the static HTML, CSS and JavaScript content to bootstrap applications in web browsers, and
2. a web API, typically a HTTP/JSON service.

We simplified the HTTP verticle implementation to _just_ cover what is needed.
Starting fron the RxJava version from step 8, we removed all server-side rendering code as well as the authentication and JWT token issuing code to expose a plain open HTTP interface.
Of course building a version that leverages JWT tokens and authentication makes sense for a real-world deployments, but we would rather focus on the essential bits in this guide.
