= Securing and controlling access

TIP: The corresponding source code is in the `step-7` folder of the guide repository.

Securing and controlling access is easy to do with Vert.x.
In this section, we will:

1. move from HTTP to HTTPS, and
2. add user authentication with group-based privileges to the web application, and
3. control access to the web API using https://jwt.io/[_JSON web tokens_ (JWT)].

== HTTPS support in Vert.x

Vert.x provides support for SSL-encrypted network connections.
It is common to expose HTTP servers in production through a front HTTP server / proxy like Nginx, and have it use HTTPS for incoming connections.
Vert.x can also expose HTTPS by itself, so as to provide end-to-end encryption.

Certificates can be stored in Java _KeyStore_ files.
You will likely need a _self-signed certificate_ for testing purposes, and here is how to create one in a `server-keystore.jks` KeyStore where the password is `secret`:

[source,text,indent=0]
----
include::gen-keystore.sh[tags=https-keygen]
----

We can then change the HTTP server creation to pass a `HttpServerOptions` object to specify that we want SSL, and to point to our KeyStore file:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=https-server]
----

We can point a web browser to https://localhost:8080/, but since the certificate is a self-signed one any good browser will rightfully yield a security warning:

Last but not least, we need to update the test case in `ApiTest` since the original code was made for issuing HTTP requests with the web client:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/ApiTest.java[tags=test-https]
----
<1> Ensures SSL.
<2> Since the certificate is self-signed, we need to explicitly trust it otherwise the web client connections will fail just like a web browser would.

== Access control and authentication

Vert.x provides a wide range of options for doing authentication and authorisation.
The officially supported modules cover JDBC, MongoDB, https://shiro.apache.org/[Apache Shiro], OAuth2 with well-known providers and JWT (JSON web tokens).

While the next section will cover JWT, this one focuses on using Apache Shiro which is especially interesting when authentication must be backed by a LDAP or Active Directory server.
In our case we will simply store the credentials in a properties file to keep things simple, but the API usage against a LDAP server remains the same.

The goal is to require users to authenticate for using the wiki, and have role-based permissions:

* having no role only allows reading pages,
* having a _writer_ role allows editing pages,
* having an _editor_ role allows creating, editing and deleting pages,
* having an _admin_ role is equivalent to having all possible roles.

=== Adding Apache Shiro authentication to routes

The first step is to add the `vertx-auth-shiro` module to the Maven dependencies list:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tags=shiro]
----

The properties file definition that we use is the following, located in `src/main/resources/wiki-users.properties`:

[source,index=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/wiki-users.properties[tags=props]
----

A `user`-prefixed entry is a user account, where the first value entry is the password possibly followed by roles.
In this example user `bar` has password `baz`, is a `writer`, and a `writer` has `update` permission.

Back to the `HttpServerVerticle` class code, we create an authentication provider using Apache Shiro:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=shiro-auth]
----

The `ShiroAuth` object instance is then used to deal with server-side user sessions:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=shiro-routes]
----
<1> We install a user session handler for all routes.
<2> This automatically redirects requests to `/login` when there is no user session for the request.
<3> We install `authHandler` for all routes where authentication is required.

Finally, we need to create 3 routes for displaying a login form, handling login form submissions and logging out users:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=shiro-login]
----
<1> `FormLoginHandler` is a helper for processing login submission requests. By default it expects the HTTP POST request to have: `username` as the login, `password` as the password, and `return_url` as the URL to redirect to upon success.
<2> Logging out a user is a simple as clearing it from the current `RoutingContext`.

The code for the `loginHandler` method is:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=loginHandler]
----

The HTML template is placed in `src/main/resources/templates/login.ftl`:

[source,html]
----
include::src/main/resources/templates/login.ftl[]
----

The login page looks as follows:

image::images/login-form.png[]

=== Supporting features based on roles

Features need to be activated only if the user has sufficient permissions based on role.
In the following screenshot an administrator can create a page and perform a backup:

image::images/as-root.png[]

By contrast a user with no role cannot perform these actions:

image::images/as-baz.png[]

To do that, we can access the `RoutingContext` user reference, and query for permissions.
Here is how this is implemented for the `indexHandler` handler method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/http/HttpServerVerticle.java[tags=indexHandler]
----
<1> This is how a permission query is made. Note that this is an asynchronous operation.
<2> We use the result to...
<3> ...leverage it is the HTML template.
<4> We also have access to the user login.

The template code has been modified to only render certain fragments based on the value of `canCreatePage`:

[source,html]
----
include::src/main/resources/templates/index.ftl[]
----

The code is similar for ensuring that updating or deleting a page is restricted to certain roles and is available from the guide Git repository.

It is important to ensure that checkings are also being done on HTTP POST request handlers and not just when rendering HTML pages.
Indeed, malicious attackers could still craft requests and perform actions while not being authenticated.
Here is how to protect page deletions by wrapping the `pageDeletionHandler` code inside a topmost permission check:
