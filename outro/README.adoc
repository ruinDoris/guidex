= Conclusion

This is the end of this guide.
Let us take a moment to recapitulate the important takeaways from the previous sections, and then conclude by pointing to further useful resources.

== Summary

We started this guide by building a wiki web application with Vert.x.
While the first iteration was typical of _"quick and dirty rapid prototyping"_ it showed that one could quickly and easily build such an application with server-side rendering of web templates and persistence with a relational database.

The next steps showed how to improve the design through successive refactoring: first separating each technical concern as a standalone verticle, then extracting Vert.x services for API cleanliness and finally introducing JUnit tests for asynchronous code.

We then ventured into consuming third-party HTTP/JSON services using the web client API that further simplifies the usage of the HTTP client from Vert.x core.
Conversely, we also saw how to expose HTTP/JSON web APIs with the elegant Vert.x web module.

From there it is very easy to extend the approach to build API gateways for providing facades to many services.
If you were to build such gateways, we suggest that you take advantage of:

* the Vert.x RxJava support to describe service consumption data flow streams, and
* the Vert.x circuit-breaker module to deal consistently with the potential failure of services.

Access control, authentication and security are often neglected or come as an aftermath.
We saw that Vert.x provides a simple pluggable authentication mechanism to leverage databases, files or LDAP directories.
SSL network encryption is very easy to setup for a server, or for a client to use.
Finally Vert.x supports JWT tokens, a very useful authentication scheme for web APIs.

The Vert.x core API relies on callbacks as it is the most generic way of processing asynchronous events.
Vert.x provides a simple promise / future API.
While Vert.x futures are composable, they shall be confined to limited usages such as dealing with verticle deployments and initialization.
We saw how RxJava is supported in Vert.x, and we encourage you to use it for your own verticles.
What's more RxJava is the most popular reactive programming library on the JVM, so you will easily find third-party libraries to integrate consistently in your end-to-end reactive applications.

Modern web applications tend to have the server expose _just_ HTTP/JSON APIs, and rely on client-side web frameworks for the user interface.
We saw how to do that with AngularJS so as to turn our wiki into a single-page application.

Finally, we saw how elegant it was to extend the event bus of an application to allow web applications to send and receive events from the browser using the SockJS bridge.
While it may initially seem like to be a small feature, in practice it turns out to greatly simplify the development of _real-time_ web application features.
The SockJS bridge can actually be useful also in cases where one would have used an HTTP endpoint: sending a message then getting a response over the event bus can sometimes be simpler than doing an HTTP call, having the server process the HTTP request, forwarding it to a verticle on the event bus and eventually terminating the HTTP exchange by encoding a JSON response.

== Going further

The http://vertx.io/[Vert.x website] is of course the authority on all things Vert.x.

There are many features and modules that we haven't covered in this guide, such as:

* clustering using Hazelcast, Infinispan, Apache Ignite or Apache Zookeeper,
* how the code looks like with other supported languages,
* exposing and consuming over HTTP/2, possibly (but not necessarily) with gRPC 
* using NoSQL databases such as MongoDB or Redis,
* sending emails over SMTP,
* messaging with AMQP, Stomp, Kafka, MQTT or RabbitMQ,
* using OAuth2 authentication from custom and popular providers,
* Vert.x sync for writing blocking-style code that is later turned into _fibers_ non-blocking code at runtime,
* publishing and discovering micro-services from registries, for instance when deploying on cloud environments like OpenShift,
* exposing metrics and health checks.

This list is not exhaustive: Vert.x is a toolkit so you are the one to decide what ingredients are required for your project, big or small.

You may also find it useful to browse the https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-awesome[Vert.x awesome] curated list of community projects as it goes beyond what is being supported by the project.

If you are developing micro-services, we suggest reading the https://developers.redhat.com/promotions/building-reactive-microservices-in-java/["Building Reactive Microservices in Java" book by Cl√©ment Escoffier].

== That's all folks!

We hope that you enjoyed reading this guide, and that it turned out to be useful in your journey towards asynchronous programming with Vert.x.

Feel-free to get in touch with the authors, either directly by email or through https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vertx/[the Vert.x project user group].
Of course we appreciate praise, but we appreciate as much any constructive feedback that can improve this content.

Thank you very much!
