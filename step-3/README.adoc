= Refactoring to Vert.x services

TIP: The corresponding source code is in the `step-3` folder of the guide repository.

The previous refactoring was a big step forward compared to our initial implementation, as we extracted independent and configurable verticles connected using asynchronous messages on the event bus.
We also saw that we could deploy several instances of a given verticle to better cope with load and to better leverage CPU cores.
