== Vert.x threading and programming models

The unit of deployment in Vert.x is called a _Verticle_.
A verticle processes incoming events over an _event-loop_, where events can be anything like receiving network buffers, timing events, or messages sent by other verticles.
Event-loops are typical in asynchronous programming models:

Each event shall be processed in a _reasonnable_ amount of time to not block the event loop.
This means that _blocking_ operations shall not be performed while executed on the event loop, exactly like processing events in a graphical user interface like Java/Swing (e.g., freezing the interface by doing a slow network request).
As we will see later in this guide, Vert.x offers mechanisms to deal with blocking operations outside of the event loop.
In any case Vert.x emits warnings in logs when the event loop has been processing an event for _too long_, which is also configurable to match application-specific requirements (e.g., when working on slower IoT ARM boards).

Every event loop is attached to a thread.
By default Vert.x attaches 2 event loops per CPU core thread.
The direct consequence is that a regular verticle always processes events on the same thread, so there is no need to use thread coordination mechanisms to manipulate a verticle state (e.g, Java class fields).

A verticle can be passed some configuration (e.g., credentials, network addresses, etc) and a verticle can be deployed several times:

Incoming network data is being received from acceptor threads and then are then passed as events to the corresponding verticles.
When a verticle opens a network server and is deployed more than once, then the events are being distributed to the verticle instances in a round-robin fashion which is very useful for maximising CPU usage with lots of concurrent networked requests.

Finally, verticles have a simple start / stop lifecycle, and verticles can deploy other verticles as the remainder of the guide will show.
